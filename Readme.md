# Zaions Tool Kit

## this is generic tool kit package created by team working at Zaions (<https://zaions.com>)

All of our packages are developed with 100% typescript support/safety, mean if you are a types lover then you will love it as well :)

### there are other packages named \"zaions-express-tool-kit\", \"zaions-react-tool-kit\", and \"zaions-react-ui-kit\". while this package is generic and contains code which will work both on frontend (reactjs/typescript) as well as on backend (nodejs/typescript) the other packages are specific to server side or client side (due to the dependencies used in them and their usage nature

- [zaions-tool-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zaions-tool-kit?activeTab=readme)
  - our most generic package, can be used in frontend or backend, frontend/backend compatible.
  - contains a lot of helper functions, utils, messages, constants and a lot more.
  - why to use this?
    - so you don't write the common helpers/constants/utils/more each time in each and every project, instead you use this one package which will help you everywhere.
- [zaions-express-tool-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zaions-express-tool-kit?activeTab=readme)
  - this package is for nodejs projects mainly using expressJs.
- [zaions-react-tool-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zaions-react-tool-kit?activeTab=readme)
  - this package is for react project, it does not contains UI components (we have a separate package for that), instead this one contains helper functions and many other help full utils to make it easy for you to create react apps.
- [zaions-react-ui-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zaions-react-ui-kit?activeTab=readme)
  - As the name suggests, it's our UI library.
  - But wait, it's not just a UI library, in fact it's a complete UI solution, with higher order components to help you detech network connectivity, errors pages to help you show meaning full errors to users when there's an error and even fully functional working pages, including (not limited to), auth pages, register, login and forget password page and much more, and it contains a lot of code to help you with form management and a lot more.
